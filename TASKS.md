# Tasks

## Feature - Mouse coordinates

Hovering any shape should also log the realtime x/y coordinates of the mouse relative to the shape dimension.

The center for these relative coordinate system should be bottom-left point of the shape.

Also, the points should show as integers.

## Feature - Adding Shapes

Here is what should happen after this feature is implemented

1. If we click anywhere on the window, a modal should open.
2. There should be a form inside the modal asking for 4 things: top, left, width and height of the shape to be
   added.
3. Submitting that form should add a new shape on the page according to the data filled in the form.
